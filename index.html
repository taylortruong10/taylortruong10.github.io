<p>Hi my name is Taylor Truong. I’m a 4th year at Western Washington University majoring in Design and minoring in UX Design. I am 21 years old and was born in Singapore on August 14th, 2001. I moved to China when I was a baby, then moved to the United States when I was 7 years old. I’ve lived in Sammamish and Issaquah for most of my life. Some of my favorite hobbies include drawing, skiing, music, gaming, and eating. My favorite food is Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine because I’m mixed with both of them! My favorite Vietnamese dish is Banh Cuon and my favorite Chinese dish is Szechuan beef noodles.</p>
